# Stock-Price-Prediction

## AIM

To develop a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model for predicting stock prices using historical data.

---

## Problem Statement and Dataset

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the non-linear and volatile nature of financial markets. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex temporal dependencies. Deep learning, specifically **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, can effectively model time-series dependencies, making them suitable for stock price forecasting.

* **Problem Statement**:
  Build an RNN model to predict the future stock price based on past stock price data.

* **Dataset**:
  A stock market dataset containing **historical daily closing prices** (e.g., Google, Apple, Tesla, or NSE/BSE data).
  The dataset is usually divided into **training and testing sets** after applying normalization and sequence generation.

## Design Steps

### Step 1:

Import required libraries such as `torch`, `torch.nn`, `torch.optim`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

### Step 2:

Load the dataset (e.g., stock closing prices from CSV), preprocess it by **normalizing** values between 0 and 1, and create input sequences for training/testing.

### Step 3:

Define the **RNN model architecture** with an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer to predict stock prices.

### Step 4:

Compile the model using **MSELoss** as the loss function and **Adam optimizer**.

### Step 5:

Train the model on the training data, recording training losses for each epoch.

### Step 6:

Test the trained model on unseen data and visualize results by plotting the **true stock prices vs. predicted stock prices**.
